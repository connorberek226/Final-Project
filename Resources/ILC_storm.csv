The tornado started out as an F0 when it first touched down south of Niota and, based on damage surveyed the following day, grew to F3 strength by the time it reached Dallas City.  Eye witnesses saw three separate funnels at on point.  The Dallas City school received major damage and one older house was blown off its foundation.  Several mobile homes were destroyed and a car was rolled six feet up a hill.  The tornado preceded to the northeast and gained in strength.  About one mile northwest of Disco the tornado reached F4 strength.  At this time the tornado was just about right on the county line between Hancock and Henderson Counties and struck the Maxine Clover farm site.  The Clover brick home was totally destroyed with only a few parts of walls still standing.  The tornado appeared to be about one-half mile wide.  The tornado continued to the northeast where it struck the Dick Edmunds farm site.  The Edmunds seventeen year old brick home was destroyed along with most of the other farm buildings.  Sixty animals had to be destroyed.  As the tornado crossed highway 94 just south of Terre Haute it only produced F0 to F1 damage, but still appeared to be about one-half mile wide by the scoured dirt path it ground into the area farm fields.  At this time the tornado was approaching the small community of Raritan.  The Wendell Shaner farm site, located one and one-half miles southwest of Raritan, was hit at this time.  Mr. Shaner was thrown about 70 yards out of his home into a field east of the house.  Mr. Shaner received broken rips and other internal injuries.  The Shaner farm site was totally destroyed.  Where the home had been located there was nothing left, but the basement stuffed full of debris.  Hundreds of dead hogs were scattered along and up a hill to the northeast of the home site.  The tornado then clipped the southeast corner of the community of Raritan where damage was limited to areas along and south of main street.  The Carl Huss home was totally destroyed while he was in the basement.  Mr. Huss received a large bruise on his back when cement blocks were pulled in from the west side of the basement as the home was shredded off its foundation.  The 137-year-old farmstead of John and Bev Livermore was also hit at about this time.  Mr. Livermore was in the basement with his two grand-children when the tornado struck.  The home heating fuel tank, located in the basement, was sucked up and thrown 50 yards away from the house.  Mr. Livermore literally had to lay on his grandson to keep him from being pulled out of the basement.  The home was totally destroyed.  The Richard Likes home, also on the east side of Raritan, was totally blown off the foundation and pushed 50 yards into the field to the east.  The Likes were not home at the time.  This is also about the time the tornado appeared to reach its maximum width of 0.6 miles.  One to two miles northeast of Rariton the large tornado either weakened or dissipated.  Regardless, F0 to F1 damage and debris continued across Warren County from either the weakened tornado or multiple spinoff tornados.  The tornado finally exited Warren county about six miles southwest of Abingdon.  This large tornado produced no fatalities and only one injury was of a serious nature.   ",,114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary of events of May 16-17, 1999:

On the 16th into the 17th two lines of thunderstorms developed: one north to south across western Iowa and the other repeatedly developed east to west from Butler to Clayton counties in northeast Iowa and moved east into northwest Illinois as a squall line.  Thunderstorms along this line strengthened as they moved east, with several storms producing large hail, funnel clouds, damaging winds, flash flooding, and one confirmed tornado.

The tornado (an F0) was spotted near Menominee in Jo Daviess County.  hail as large as golf balls fell in East Dubuque (also in Jo Daviess County).   Severe thunderstorm winds caused structural damage across portions of Stephenson, Whiteside, Carroll, Henry, and Bureau Counties.  The costliest and most dramatic damage, however, did not come from tornadoes or hail but rather from flash flooding.   

Several inches of rain fell over portions of East Dubuque in only a few hours, causing a major flash flood in downtown.  Water flowed down a street and into the Mississippi River, ripping up pavement and washing away cars as it went.

The outflow intersected an advancing cold front over East Central Iowa, which enhanced low level convergence.  However, the atmosphere remained strongly capped, which allowed for only isolated thunderstorms to develop over Eastern Iowa by mid afternoon.  These storms did not generate any reports of severe weather in Eastern Iowa, although they did produce heavy rain, gusty winds and small hail.  As the thunderstorms crossed the Mississippi River into West Central Illinois during the evening they intensified.  The cap had eroded with the aid of an upper level jet max.  The atmosphere was very unstable with Capes of 2500-3500 J/Kg, while deep layer shear from the surface to 6 kilometers was marginal for supercells at 30 to 40 knots. The storms quickly became severe producing large hail and damaging winds in Hancock, Warren and Henry Counties.  A weak, short lived tornado was spawned by one of the storms 4 miles west of Kewanee.

A 53-year-old man was killed when the chimney of his house collapsed on him. The man, who was in his basement, was protecting his son by lying on top of him when the collapse occurred. The son received broken bones. Their house was impaled by some nearby large trees that prevented it from being swept farther away. Along the Pulaski County portion of the tornado path, six single family homes and ten mobile homes were destroyed. Another ten single family homes and a mobile home had major damage. A few dozen other residences received some type of minor damage. A few dozen outbuildings, two businesses, and a campground were destroyed or had major damage. Approximately 13 persons were injured, but only a few of those required hospitalization. All roads in the damage area were impassable due to large numbers of trees and building debris on them.

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries.

The tornado passed just west and northwest of Golconda before ending about a mile north of town. Just west of Golconda, the roof was blown off the county elementary school's gymnasium.  Despite the seven destroyed residences, not one injury was reported. The maximum intensity of the tornado was rated F-3 in Pope County, and F-4 in Massac and Pulaski Counties. The slightly lower intensity of the tornado, combined with the fact it narrowly missed the center of several Pope County communities, may partly explain the lack of injuries.

The deadliest and longest lived tornado started at 1644 CST, 0.7 miles North Northeast of Florid in Putnam County and moved northeast toward Granville.  The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).
	Witnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.  The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.  Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town.  In a strange twist of irony, the town had finally recovered from a major fire 4 years earlier that decimated much of the business district.  The tornado continued northeast out of Granville and crossed over into La Salle County (WFO LOT) at 1653 CST (2253 Z), 3.8 miles Northeast of Granville.
	The Granville/Utica tornado was the first significant test of a new statewide mutual aid response agreement.  In Granville 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an eldery female who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually Life Flighted to a Peoria hospital.  Injuries were low due to the 32 minutes of lead time before the tornado struck Granville. Damage in Granville is estimated to be at least $8 million with the school suffering at least $3.5 million in damage.",196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the tornado continued northeast, F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads.  Several roofs were blown off homes along with damage to external walls.  Significant tree damage was done as well.  Path width was estimated at 50 yards at this location.  The tornado then continued northeast, crossing the Illinois River twice as it moved toward the town of Utica, downing a steel high tension tower on the north bank of the river, immediately west of Illinois 251.  The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged on Division between Johnson and Washington. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off and north walls blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point. On the east edge of the vortex along Mill Street, in downtown, buildings suffered damage to facades, roofs and windows. East of Mill Street there was damage to trees and minor roof damage. In the northeast section of town a mobile home was overturned on Grove, just east of Mill Street. The vortex crossed the railroad tracks and apparently dissipated on a steep bluff on the northeast side of town. At the top of the hill there were some trees and limbs down and some debris deposited.

From the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.

From the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.

At this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke.

Nearby, a house was unroofed, and trees were snapped or uprooted. Another house lost a room that was added on. A swing set was blown 200 yards and wrapped around a mailbox. An empty tractor trailer rig was overturned. An empty grain bin was blown 100 yards into a field. Full grain bins were severely damaged but remained in place. The roof was blown off a brick house. As the tornado crossed Route 3, high tension utility poles were snapped off, hundreds of acres of corn were flattened, and trees were uprooted. Route 3 was closed for nine hours. From Route 3, the tornado proceeded east-northeast through mostly rural areas of the county, including the Kinkaid Lake State Wildlife Area. The tornado weakened to F-0 intensity before reaching Kinkaid Lake. At the Kinkaid Lake marina, about 50 RV's and boats were damaged, and trees were broken off. The tornado finally lifted shortly after crossing Highway 127 north of Murphysboro. The damage along Highway 127 was about 75 yards wide and consisted of broken tree limbs. A state trooper videotaped the tornado before it lifted. Storm chasers also videotaped the tornado. Peak winds where F-2 damage occurred in western Jackson County were estimated near 150 MPH.

The initial touchdown was in a corn field where the corn was laid down in a convergent pattern.  At this location, the tornado was approximately 20 yards wide.  The tornado then crossed County Road 2100 North where it caused damage to trees and a small corn silo next to a farm house.  Just behind this farm house, several large trees were broken near their base with one tree uprooted.  Most of these trees were around three feet in diameter.  Some internal rot was noted in a few of the trees making them more susceptible to wind damage.  The tornado then appears to have lifted briefly before touching down again just behind a home along County Road 2200 East, between County Roads 2100 North and 2150 North.  At this location, significant tree damage was observed with multiple limbs between one and two feet in diameter being broken and falling in a convergent manner.  Also at this location, a detached garage was destroyed with debris being scattered 50 to 100 feet to the northeast.  This appears to be the point along the damage path where the tornado reached its maximum intensity with an estimated peak wind speed of 105 mph and a width of 50 yards.  The tornado then crossed County Road 2100 East causing damage to corn along both County Road 2100 East and County Road 2150 North.  After crossing County Road 2150 North, the tornado destroyed a barn housing farming equipment, measuring 44 by 72 feet.  Debris from this barn was scattered in all directions from the barn's original location.  Several pieces of farm equipment estimated to weigh between 5,000 and 15,000 pounds were moved several feet north and northeast of their original location including a grain wagon which was lifted and placed on top of other farm equipment.  After destroying the barn, the tornado moved northeast through a corn field where additional crop damage was observed.  The tornado then again briefly lifted before striking a home and a detached garage along County Road 2340 East.  Siding and minor roof and shingle damage was observed on the house and the detached garage lost its roof and suffered a collapse of the south wall.  At this location, the tornado was estimated to be about 40 yards wide.

Damage became more consistent again as the tornado moved east of E 12th Road, remaining just north of N 12th Road. The tornado appears to have remained on the ground from this point east into the city of Streator. The damage from E 9th Road east to E 15th Road was rated EF0 intensity and consisted primarily of minor tree damage.||The tornado appears to have intensified as it moved into the city of Streator with EF2 intensity damage near the Eagle Pass subdivision where there was significant tree damage, along with portions of roofs removed from well built single family homes. The tornado continued eastward across southern portions of the city of Streator, damaging numerous homes and completely destroying several homes. Some of the most intense damage in Streator occurred along Hall Street and near Southside Athletic Park, where damage was rated higher end EF2. The most intense damage occurred through an approximately one quarter mile wide path through the city of Streator.||Twenty one homes were uninhabitable and had to be destroyed. Another 33 homes were uninhabitable and had to undergo major repair. Another 150 homes had some degree of damage.  ||A few businesses were also damaged including the Engle Lane Theater, an auto salvage business, an auto repair shop, and a landscape and nursery business. ||The tornado then continued eastward out of the city of Streator producing additional EF0 to EF1 intensity damage just north of the Livingston and LaSalle county border.
