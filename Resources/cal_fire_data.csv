Eventually 6532 acres would be burned, along with numerous infrastructure supporting utilities and highway transportation before it was fully contained three days later.

Between 50 to 70 trains and 13,000 trucks move through the Cajon Pass on a daily basis. This blockage affected shipping in and out of Long Beach Harbor, a major West Coast shipping port. In addition to burning 57 power poles, heat from the fire forced the shutting down of all power transmission lines and a natural gas line across the mountains. These outages in turn affected about 500,000 customers in communities far removed from the incident site. Initially 40 homes were evacuated the first day in the Swarthout Canyon area.  A flare up on the second day forced an evacuation of 100 homes in the Mormon Rocks area. Smoke blown over the Victor Valley caused air quality to dip below healthful levels at times.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield).

In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night.

Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs.

There were 18,804 structures destroyed, 13,696 of them single homes, along with 514 commercial structures and 3,718 outbuildings and 153,336 acres burned.

Local wind gusts to 40 to 50 mph were measured nearby at Jarbo Gap, with a peak gust in the early morning of 52 mph. These winds caused the fire to spread very quickly. The fire forced the rapid evacuation of over 27,000 people from Paradise, Magalia, Centerville, Concow, Pulga, Butte Creek Canyon, Berry Creek and Yankee Hill. The fire also threatened the communities of Butte Valley, Chico, Forest Ranch, Helltown, Inskip, Oroville, and Stirling City. All residents were not allowed to return home until December 15, when the final evacuation orders were lifted. |Smoke from the fire was dense at times across much of Northern California, concentrated by strong atmospheric inversions. Air quality was reported by the Air Resources Board as some of the worst on record, causing many schools to close and events to be canceled across the area. Visibility was below 1/2 mile at times.|The cause of the fire is under investigation, though there evidence suggests it occurred near damaged power lines.","An extended period of dry weather through the summer and fall with above normal temperatures coupled with a gusty north to northeast wind event created a situation for extremely rapid fire growth.
