Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Calhoun County officials reported 15 to 20 homes surrounded by high water and severe erosion to numerous unpaved county roads.  Across Coastal and Inland Walton County, storm surges of 10 to 12 feet above tide levels caused extensive beach erosion and undermined numerous coastal structures.  Considerable coastal flooding damaged several homes and businesses.  132 roads were closed including Interstate 10 from Mossy Head to Crestview.  Five people stranded on the Shoal River Bridge near CR 1087 were rescued by boat.  An earthen dam at Kings Lake threatened to breach and 100 residents were evacuated.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Helene quickly weakened to a tropical depression Friday afternoon as it accelerated northeast into southeast Alabama.  Storm total rainfall ranged from a half inch at Perry and to 9.56 inches at Apalachicola, Florida.  The highest sustained wind of 30 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph was recorded at Cape San Blas.  The lowest sea-level pressure was 1011 mb at Panama City.  

Coastal storm tides of two feet or less above astronomical tide levels were common, with only minor beach erosion reported.  The torrential rainfall caused extensive flooding throughout Franklin, Wakulla and Leon counties.  The flooding prompted city and county officials to close schools, universities and public offices and kept emergency crews busy rescuing stranded motorists.  Utility crews worked diligently to restore power to homes, and clearing streets and county roads of storm debris.  Numerous homes along the Sopchoppy River in Wakulla County were flooded, with secondary and county roads washed out.  The river crested at 34.9 feet, breaking the record of 34 feet in 1970.  Numerous homes in northern Wakulla County were affected when sinkholes backed up with flood waters.  Flooding was also reported at Walker Crossing and at the Wildwood Golf Course near Medart.  Nearly 70 streets in Tallahassee were impassable due to high water.  Over 100 homes in Leon County were affected by flood waters.  50 residents were evacuated from the flooded Carriage Estates mobile home park and another 20 were rescued from the Sandpebble Apartments in Tallahassee.  Scattered power outages left 5,000 homes without electricity in Leon and Wakulla counties when water-logged tree limbs were blown into power lines.  Minor flooding was reported in Bay, Jefferson, Calhoun, Madison and Gulf counties.

Numerous tornadoes were reported. In Franklin County, brief touchdowns at Alligator Point, Eastpoint and in several rural wooded areas.  In Wakulla County, two touchdowns, of which one destroyed several mobile homes.  In Jefferson County, two touchdowns which damaged two mobile homes, a barn and vehicle.

After landfall, Barry rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over southwest Alabama.  Maximum sustained winds prior to landfall were measured at 39 knots with a peak gust to 54 knots at the Gulf data buoy 42039 (85 nautical miles south of Apalachicola, Florida) during the late afternoon of 5 August.  As the center of Barry moved onshore, a peak wind gust of 55 knots was recorded at the Eglin AFB Range Station C-52 (10 miles northwest of Freeport, Florida, in Walton County) about 130 am CDT on 6 August.  At the same location, the lowest sea-level pressure recorded was 994.2 mb at 1247 am CDT.  Scattered wind damage was reported throughout Walton, Washington, Bay, Calhoun and Gulf counties as trees and limbs fell into power lines.  Over 40,000 homes were without power.  In Bay County, several homes were inundated by water due to roof damage.

Due to its slow motion toward the Florida Panhandle coast, rainbands affected the coastal areas as early as the late afternoon of 4 August, with the heaviest rainfall observed on 5-6 August.  Official storm totals ranged from 2.37 inches at Marianna  to 8.91 inches at Tallahassee, Florida.  An unofficial total of 11 inches was reported by WJHG-TV in Panama City, Florida.

Maximum storm tides ranged from a foot in coastal Franklin County, to three feet in coastal Walton County where minor beach erosion was reported.  Minor to no beach erosion was observed from coastal Bay, Gulf and Franklin counties.  

Significant flooding occurred in Leon County, including the Tallahassee area, as well as the northwest Apalachicola National Forest, where excessive rains flowed southward into the Cascade Lakes, Lake Bradford and Munson Slough.  The Munson Slough rose to its highest level since the 1994 floods.  Dozens of homes were affected, as well as horses, livestock, vehicles and equipment.  Numerous county and secondary roads across Walton, Washington, and Bay counties were closed to floodwaters.",,273,,,,

Major beach erosion occurred on Dauphin Island and along the beaches of Baldwin county in  Alabama, as well as along the Florida panhandle coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.  
Major storm tide flooding occurred in Mobile County Alabama on the west end of Dauphin Island,  along low lying coastal areas of the southern part of the county, and along the Causeway that crosses the northern part of Mobile Bay.  Storm tide flooding also occurred in Baldwin County, primarily in the West Beach and Orange Beach areas.  Storm tide flooding also occurred along portions of the Florida coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.

Major beach erosion occurred on Dauphin Island and along the beaches of Baldwin county in  Alabama, as well as along the Florida panhandle coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.  
Major storm tide flooding occurred in Mobile County Alabama on the west end of Dauphin Island,  along low lying coastal areas of the southern part of the county, and along the Causeway that crosses the northern part of Mobile Bay.  Storm tide flooding also occurred in Baldwin County, primarily in the West Beach and Orange Beach areas.  Storm tide flooding also occurred along portions of the Florida coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.   Moderate river flooding occurred in Mobile and Baldwin counties in Alabama, with some river flooding also reported in Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa counties of the Florida panhandle.  
Two F0 tornadoes occurred in coastal Okaloosa county in Florida, two F0 tornadoes occurred in coastal Baldwin county of Alabama and one F0 In Mobile county.  Minor structural damage was reported with each tornado, but for the most part, only tree damage occurred.  
Primary storm effects were along the coasts of Alabama and the Florida panhandle.    In Mobile county, the main effects were the tidal flooding that occurred on Dauphin Island.

The causeway at the northern end of Mobile Bay was closed for a time due to high water, and some of the businesses on the causeway were flooded.   Some houses along Bayou Sara and the Fowl River  had some water in them.    In Baldwin County, major beach erosion occurred along an area know as West Beach.  Surges in this area were estimated at 5.5 to 6.5 feet.  Wind driven waves on top of this surge deposited sand across West Beach Road and the wave action removed a couple of feet of sand from underneath several beach houses.  Some houses along the Fish River were also flooded.  In Escambia County major beach erosion occurred on Pensacola Beach.

Early on August 13, the hurricane intensified to Category 4 status and turned to a north northeast direction before making landfall near Port Charlotte around 3 PM EDT. The first outer rainband, with wind gusts estimated up to 60 mph,  impacted the south Florida Peninsula between midnight and 2 AM EDT 

In Collier County, a peak wind gust of 84 mph was measured at 2:50 PM EDT on the top of a condominium at Vanderbilt Beach before the equipment failed.  The Naples ASOS equipment failed well before the maximum winds or minimum pressure occurred.  Wind gusts at La Belle were estimated at 80 mph.

Rainfall in most locations in Collier County was around two inches with an unofficial amount of 7.5 inches reported in North Naples.  Radar rainfall estimates of locally 8 to 10 inches were made in North Naples. Flooding was mostly minimal. 

The highest Storm Tide along the southwest Florida Coast was estimated at three feet near Wiggins Pass with heights of one to two feet from Naples to Marco Island to Everglades City. Tidal flooding was minimal. Lake Okeechobee levels increased up to three feet above normal along the north and northeast shores.

A long-track tornado moved through the open country of the Everglades in eastern Hendry County before doing minor damage to buildings in Clewiston.

Hurricane wind damage was greatest in North Naples and Vanderbilt Beach with numerous power poles, trees and signs blown down, and a few roofs damaged.

Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. 

Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward. 

The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.

Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county. 

In Lee County, Hurricane Charley caused an estimated eight foot storm surge that cut a new pass 300 yards wide across North Captiva Island.  The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County. There was one direct death attributed to the storm when a tree fell on a person outside smoking.

The Ormond Beach area was hit especially hard with east winds off the Atlantic as the hurricane center moved off the coast just to the south near Daytona Beach. Hundreds of trees were blown down and roofs were severely damaged on three beachfront hotels. Because the duration of the onshore wind was so brief, there was negligible storm surge. Minor roadway flooding occurred from the two to four inches of rain that fell.  A strong F1 touched down in South Daytona Beach with the primary rainband ahead of the hurricane. This tornado destroyed a home and severly damaged three others, mainly from fallen trees.  The roof was blown off a strip mall store and a fire was started at a service station when the tornado destroyed the gas pumps and blew down the service island canopy.  A smaller F0 tornado also came ashore on the barrier island injuring an elderly woman and damaging the roof of her house.  Two fatalities were attributed to Hurricane Charley.

Frances was moving to the west northwest at 7 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed the east half of the Florida Peninsula. Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon on the 5th when it was about 50 miles east of Tampa Bay.  

In Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties, the slow moving storm produced wind gusts to hurricane strength for about 19 hours, producing an estimated 4.5 billion dollars in damage. Wind gusts well over 100 mph destroyed coastal structures, marinas, and vessels.  Farther inland, hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed, and thousands were damaged.  Highest recorded winds for Martin county were 91 knots (105 mph) at Port St. Lucie Inlet. The highest wind gust in St. Lucie County, was 94 knots (108 mph) at Ft. Pierce and in Indian River County, 70 knots ( 81 mph) in Vero Beach. 

Brevard and Volusia counties also recorded hours of hurricane force wind gusts from the north side of the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed and damaged, with hundreds of thousands of residences with out power. Brevard was hit with an estimated damage of 90 million dollars. Damage in Volusia County was close to 240 million dollars. Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out.  Highest recorded surface winds gust was 78 knots (90 mph) from Merritt Island Airport, although a wind tower at NASA report gusts to 82 knots (94 mph).  These winds were likely representative of what most of the beach front areas were hit with. Daytona Beach International Airport recorded a wind gust to 65 knots (75 mph) prior to the power outage.  

Lowest recorded pressures for Hurricane Frances were, 994.9 mb at Daytona Beach Airport, 995.9 mb at NWS Melbourne, 962.1 at St. Lucie Lock, and 964.7 at Port Mayaca Lock.  

Beach errosion was moderate to severe from Cocoa Beach to Ft. Pierce, ranging from 5 to 6 feet from south Brevard County to up to 12 feet near Vero Beach where a large section of a beach road was washed out.  A storm surge of 5.89 feet MSL was recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. A surge near 6 feet occured near Cocoa Beach ranging to near 8 feet around Vero Beach where onshore winds were the strongest. 

Radar estimates show as much as 13 inches of rain fell in Volusia County with a range of 6 to 10 inches of rain in the remaining counties. The worst flooding from Hurricane Frances was in Volusia, Seminole, Orange and Osceola counties.  Significant inland flooding was reported in Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and Brevard counties.",392,,,,

Frances was moving to the west northwest at 7 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed the east half of the Florida Peninsula. Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon on the 5th when it was about 50 miles east of Tampa Bay.  

In Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties, the slow moving storm produced wind gusts to hurricane strength for about 19 hours, producing an estimated 4.5 billion dollars in damage. Wind gusts well over 100 mph destroyed coastal structures, marinas, and vessels.  Farther inland, hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed, and thousands were damaged.  Highest recorded winds for Martin county were 91 knots (105 mph) at Port St. Lucie Inlet. The highest wind gust in St. Lucie County, was 94 knots (108 mph) at Ft. Pierce and in Indian River County, 70 knots ( 81 mph) in Vero Beach. 

Brevard and Volusia counties also recorded hours of hurricane force wind gusts from the north side of the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed and damaged, with hundreds of thousands of residences with out power. Brevard was hit with an estimated damage of 90 million dollars. Damage in Volusia County was close to 240 million dollars. Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out.  Highest recorded surface winds gust was 78 knots (90 mph) from Merritt Island Airport, although a wind tower at NASA report gusts to 82 knots (94 mph).  These winds were likely representative of what most of the beach front areas were hit with. Daytona Beach International Airport recorded a wind gust to 65 knots (75 mph) prior to the power outage.  

Lowest recorded pressures for Hurricane Frances were, 994.9 mb at Daytona Beach Airport, 995.9 mb at NWS Melbourne, 962.1 at St. Lucie Lock, and 964.7 at Port Mayaca Lock.  

Beach errosion was moderate to severe from Cocoa Beach to Ft. Pierce, ranging from 5 to 6 feet from south Brevard County to up to 12 feet near Vero Beach where a large section of a beach road was washed out.  A storm surge of 5.89 feet MSL was recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. A surge near 6 feet occured near Cocoa Beach ranging to near 8 feet around Vero Beach where onshore winds were the strongest. 

Radar estimates show as much as 13 inches of rain fell in Volusia County with a range of 6 to 10 inches of rain in the remaining counties.

Remarkably, this is in the same location where Hurricane Frances came ashore on September 5th. Jeanne was moving to the west northwest at 12 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed most of the Florida Peninsula. Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon of September 26th when it was about 40 miles northeast of Tampa Bay. 

In Volusia County, hurricane force wind gusts began with the rain bands on the north side of Jeanne as they moved on shore. The county, already battered by Hurricane Frances suffered extensive additional damage. Fresh water flooding from local heavy rain, and Flooding of the St. Johns River affected more than 200 residences and business properties. Total damage estimates were near $60 million.  Hurricane winds damaged or destroyed thousands of  homes and businesses. Hundreds of thousands of residences were with out power.  Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out. The highest recorded wind was only 55 knots (63 mph), but wind damage suggest numerous gusts in excess of hurricane strength.  The lowest recorded pressure was 993.6 mb.     

In Brevard County, the strongest winds swept across the coast south of Cape Canaveral and the southern coastal communities. Grant, Micco and the south part of Palm Bay were hit much harder than the northern locations. County wide damages were reported at $320 million. Especially hard hit was the mobile home community of Barefoot Bay. A Palm Bay man drowned when his pickup truck ran off a road into a deep flooded ditch. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 79 knots (91 mph) at the NWS Melbourne office. Based on radar information, it is estimated that wind gusts over 100 kts (115 mph) swept across the southern coastal areas. The lowest recorded pressure for the storm was 986.8 mb at Melbourne. Total damage estimates for the county were near $320 million. 

Indian River County was hit hard by Jeanne being to the right of the land falling eye. 8,300 residences were damaged or destroyed and over 41,000 residences were damaged. Total wind damage for the county was over $2 billion. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 106 knots (122 mph) at Vero Beach and 101 knots (116 mph) at Sebastian.  The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 965.5 mb at Vero Beach. 

The north part of the hurricane eye passed over St. Lucie County producing $1.2 billion in wind damage. The marinas along Ft. Pierce inlet were hit destroying dozens of boats.  A 34 year old man was electrocuted when his truck ran into a power line.  Thousands of homes and business were damaged and destroyed by the wind. Especially hard hit were the dozens of mobile home communities. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 111 knots (128 mph) from a private residence just north of Ft. Pierce inlet. The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 952.9 mb at Ft. Pierce. 

The eye of Hurricane Jeanne passed over the community of Sewell' Point in Martin County. Over 180 residences were destroyed with about 4000 residences either damaged or destroyed.  The highest wind speed recorded was 91 kts (105 mph) in Jensen Beach.  No pressure data was recorded for Martin County.

It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula.

Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee.

A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch. Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County.

The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.

There were no confirmed tornadoes.

There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. 

Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties.

A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.  Agricultural  Damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at $30 million.

Florida Power and Light reported outages occurred to 591,300 customers in Palm Beach, 165,900 in Broward, 25,100 in Miami-Dade, 5,200 in Collier, 3,000 in Hendry and 1,500 in Glades. An estimated 12,534 persons sought refuge in public shelters in Palm Beach County.",467,,,,

Remarkably, this is in the same location where Hurricane Frances came ashore on September 5th. Jeanne was moving to the west northwest at 12 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed most of the Florida Peninsula. Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon of September 26th when it was about 40 miles northeast of Tampa Bay. 

In Volusia County, hurricane force wind gusts began with the rain bands on the north side of Jeanne as they moved on shore. The county, already battered by Hurricane Frances suffered extensive additional damage. Fresh water flooding from local heavy rain, and Flooding of the St. Johns River affected more than 200 residences and business properties. Total damage estimates were near $60 million.  Hurricane winds damaged or destroyed thousands of  homes and businesses. Hundreds of thousands of residences were with out power.  Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out. The highest recorded wind was only 55 knots (63 mph), but wind damage suggest numerous gusts in excess of hurricane strength.  The lowest recorded pressure was 993.6 mb.     

In Brevard County, the strongest winds swept across the coast south of Cape Canaveral and the southern coastal communities. Grant, Micco and the south part of Palm Bay were hit much harder than the northern locations. County wide damages were reported at $320 million. Especially hard hit was the mobile home community of Barefoot Bay. A Palm Bay man drowned when his pickup truck ran off a road into a deep flooded ditch. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 79 knots (91 mph) at the NWS Melbourne office. Based on radar information, it is estimated that wind gusts over 100 kts (115 mph) swept across the southern coastal areas. The lowest recorded pressure for the storm was 986.8 mb at Melbourne. Total damage estimates for the county were near $320 million.

Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland.

The tropical wave became a tropical depression near the central Bahamas late on August 22.  The depression moved slowly northwest and became tropical storm Katrina on August 24 near the northwest Bahama Islands then turned west and intensified to a hurricane on August 25, a few hours before making landfall on the southeast Florida Coast.

The center of the ragged 25-mile-wide eye of Katrina made landfall around 6:30 PM EDT, Thursday, August 25 near the Broward/Miami-Dade County border then moved toward the southwest across central and southwest Miami-Dade County, passing directly over the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Sweetwater.  Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before exiting the Florida peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 26 just north of Cape Sable in mainland Monroe County then quickly regained hurricane strength in the southeast Gulf of Mexico.  The distribution of winds and rain near the center of Katrina while passing across the south Florida peninsula were asymmetrical with the strongest winds and heaviest rain located to the south and east of the center.

Measurements from reconnaissance aircraft and Miami Doppler Weather Radar estimated maximum sustained winds in Katrina to be 80 mph.  The maximum reported sustained surface wind over the south Florida peninsula was 72 mph measured atop a building at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on Virginia Key.  This wind value was determined by adjusting the actual wind speed to the standard anemometer height of 10 meters.  This same site recorded an unadjusted peak wind speed of 94 mph.  The anemometer atop the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater measured a sustained wind of 69 mph.  Maximum sustained winds measured at the NWS Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sites included 60 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 50 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall and 48 mph at Miami International Airport.

The maximum ASOS-measured peak wind gusts included 82 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 78 mph at Miami International Airport and 76 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall.  Other unofficial peak wind gust measurements included 97 mph at Homestead General Airport, 92 mph at Port Everglades, 87 mph at the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater, 77 mph at Marco Island, 76 mph at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) on Virginia Key, and 64 mph at Boca Raton Airport.  The minimum pressure measured over the south Florida peninsula was 983.1 millibars at the NWS site in Sweetwater.

Rainfall amounts were excessive across portions of south Miami-Dade County causing flooding of structures, vehicles, crop lands and nurseries.  A maximum storm total amount of 16.33 inches, of which 15.10 inches fell in a 24-hour period, was measured by a cooperative observed in Perrine.  Other heavy storm total amounts in south Miami-Dade County included 14.04 inches at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 12.25 inches near Florida City and 11.13 inches near Cutler Ridge.  Most of the remainder of metropolitan Miami-Dade County and all of metropolitan Broward and Palm Beach counties generally received rain amounts of two to four inches.  Rainfall over interior south Florida ranged from one to three inches with mostly less than one inch over coastal Collier County.

Mostly minor beach erosion and isolated incidence of coastal flooding were observed.  The maximum storm tide was estimated at three to five feet along the southwest Florida coast in mainland Monroe County.  This caused water damage to several homes, trailers and vehicles at Flamingo in Everglades National Park early on August 26.  Other maximum storm tide values included 3.0 feet at Naples Pier along the southwest coast at 2.1 feet at Virginia Key on the southeast coast.

A total of six persons are known to have died directly as a result of the winds and water.  Three of the deaths, all in Broward County, were associated with trees or tree limbs that were blown down, striking people.  The other three deaths, all in Miami-Dade County, were associated with drownings, two on boats and one under unknown circumstances.  In addition at least another six people died from indirect hurricane effects including three from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one in a vehicle accident, one during debris cleanup and one associated with a lack of electricity.  Several people were injured, including five or six related to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Total damage in south Florida was estimated at around $100 million.  Between 100 and 200 houses suffered significant damage, mainly in south Miami-Dade due to flooding. Wind damage was mainly to vegetation, signs, and watercraft.  Winds and flooding combined caused an estimated $423 million in losses to agriculture and nurseries.",81,,,,

This caused water damage to several homes, trailers and vehicles at Flamingo in Everglades National Park early on August 26.  Other maximum storm tide values included 3.0 feet at Naples Pier along the southwest coast at 2.1 feet at Virginia Key on the southeast coast.

A total of six persons are known to have died directly as a result of the winds and water.  Three of the deaths, all in Broward County, were associated with trees or tree limbs that were blown down, striking people.  The other three deaths, all in Miami-Dade County, were associated with drownings, two on boats and one under unknown circumstances.  In addition at least another six people died from indirect hurricane effects including three from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one in a vehicle accident, one during debris cleanup and one associated with a lack of electricity.  Several people were injured, including five or six related to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Total damage in south Florida was estimated at around $100 million.  Between 100 and 200 houses suffered significant damage, mainly in south Miami-Dade due to flooding. Wind damage was mainly to vegetation, signs, and watercraft.  Winds and flooding combined caused an estimated $423 million in losses to agriculture and nurseries.",82,,,,

The tropical wave became a tropical depression near the central Bahamas late on August 22.  The depression moved slowly northwest and became tropical storm Katrina on August 24 near the northwest Bahama Islands then turned west and intensified to a hurricane on August 25, a few hours before making landfall on the southeast Florida Coast.

The center of the ragged 25-mile-wide eye of Katrina made landfall around 6:30 PM EDT, Thursday, August 25 near the Broward/Miami-Dade County border then moved toward the southwest across central and southwest Miami-Dade County, passing directly over the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Sweetwater.  Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before exiting the Florida peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 26 just north of Cape Sable in mainland Monroe County then quickly regained hurricane strength in the southeast Gulf of Mexico.  The distribution of winds and rain near the center of Katrina while passing across the south Florida peninsula were asymmetrical with the strongest winds and heaviest rain located to the south and east of the center.

Measurements from reconnaissance aircraft and Miami Doppler Weather Radar estimated maximum sustained winds in Katrina to be 80 mph.  The maximum reported sustained surface wind over the south Florida peninsula was 72 mph measured atop a building at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on Virginia Key.  This wind value was determined by adjusting the actual wind speed to the standard anemometer height of 10 meters.  This same site recorded an unadjusted peak wind speed of 94 mph.  The anemometer atop the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater measured a sustained wind of 69 mph.  Maximum sustained winds measured at the NWS Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sites included 60 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 50 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall and 48 mph at Miami International Airport.

The maximum ASOS-measured peak wind gusts included 82 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 78 mph at Miami International Airport and 76 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall.  Other unofficial peak wind gust measurements included 97 mph at Homestead General Airport, 92 mph at Port Everglades, 87 mph at the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater, 77 mph at Marco Island, 76 mph at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) on Virginia Key, and 64 mph at Boca Raton Airport.  The minimum pressure measured over the south Florida peninsula was 983.1 millibars at the NWS site in Sweetwater.

Rainfall amounts were excessive across portions of south Miami-Dade County causing flooding of structures, vehicles, crop lands and nurseries.  A maximum storm total amount of 16.33 inches, of which 15.10 inches fell in a 24-hour period, was measured by a cooperative observed in Perrine.  Other heavy storm total amounts in south Miami-Dade County included 14.04 inches at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 12.25 inches near Florida City and 11.13 inches near Cutler Ridge.  Most of the remainder of metropolitan Miami-Dade County and all of metropolitan Broward and Palm Beach counties generally received rain amounts of two to four inches.  Rainfall over interior south Florida ranged from one to three inches with mostly less than one inch over coastal Collier County.

Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.

   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb. 

  Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.   

  Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours.

 Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.

  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami. 

 In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.

  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes. 

  One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes.

Two mobile homes were destroyed, otherwise Hurricane Wilma produced widespread minor wind damage across the county with trees and power lines down and damage to roofs and out buildings. A minor league baseball stadium was severely damaged and the roof was blown off of the St. Lucie County civic center. Total crop loss including vegetables, citrus and sugar equals $28 million.  As much as 6 inches of rain fell across the county. Ft. Pierce Airport recorded a wind gust to 77 mph (68 knots) with sustained winds of 52 mph (45 knots). Lowest recorded surface pressure was 968.5 millibars in Ft. Pierce Airport.  

The northern half of the eyewall of Hurricane Wilma moved over coastal Martin County as Wilma moved off shore. The strongest winds in Martin County occurred as the winds backed to the north with the large eye of Wilma over the coast of Martin County.  Estimated wind gust over 100 mph occurred along the beaches. Wilma produced widespread wind damage across the county. Forty eight residences were destroyed and 120 suffered major damage. Most of these were mobile homes. More than 90 percent of Martin County was without electricity.  The county's main hospital, Martin Memorial, sustained enough damage to stop taking new patients.  As much as 3 to 5  inches of rain fell across the county. Total crop loss including vegetables, citrus and sugar equals $48 million.

Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.

   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb. 

  Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.   

  Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours.

 Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.

  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami. 

 In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.

  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes. 

  One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes. Small swaths of greater damage elsewhere in South Florida have not been attributed to tornadoes, but were instead likely caused by  mini-swirls"""," small vortices within the eye wall that have been observed in previous strong hurricanes such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992.""",118.0

Flooding caused $970,000 to roads and homes, while wind caused $470,000 in mostly minor damage to numerous homes, especially in Lee County.  The flood and tornado monetary damage were listed in their respective Storm Data categories. ||Lee County���Heavy rains of 6-14 inches caused extensive sheet flow flooding from the Imperial River that runs through Bonita Springs. Flood damage was reported to numerous roads and homes with 500 residents evacuated to shelters.  The preliminary damage estimates included $250,000 of flood damage to roads and $500,000 of flood and wind damage to homes with 170 manufactured homes condemned. Many of these homes had unpermitted modifications to increase their size.  These modifications were destroyed leaving gaping holes in the home. Minor beach erosion was reported.  The tide was 2 feet below normal as Fay made landfall then was 1 to 2 feet above normal for two days due to onshore winds. ||Charlotte County���The Punta Gorda Airport recorded a peak wind of 47 MPH at 10:13 AM EDT on the 19th.  Minor beach erosion occurred but no other significant damage was reported. ||Highlands County���A 54-year-old male died on August 16th from carbon monoxide poisoning as he tested his backup generator in his garage in Lake Placid. This was considered an indirect fatality due to Fay.  Widespread heavy rains of 5-12 inches caused $150,000 in flood damage to washed out roads and culverts.  Prefabrication metal buildings sustained wind damage that allowed rain into the buildings of three fire stations and several buildings of an electric coop with water damage estimated at $175,000.

By the 24th, Fay had weakened to a depression and continued moving westward into southeastern Mississippi.  Besides the torrential rainfall associated with Fay, sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph with gusts to 50 mph downed many trees and power lines.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees as well as the tropical storm-force wind gusts.  A tornado briefly touced down in a wooded area of Jefferson County on the 23rd.  A Talquin Electric linesman was electrocuted while working to restore power in Quincy when a tree fell across a nearby power line.  A Jefferson County man lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a flooded wooded area and drowned.  A man was killed during a heavy rain storm in Bay County when he lost control of his vehicle and collided with a large pine tree.

Due to the very expansive wind fields associated with the hurricane, sustained tropical storm winds reached the east-central Florida beaches and adjacent portions of the barrier islands. Gusts to tropical storm force occurred throughout the coastal counties, with some interior counties also experiencing tropical storm gusts, especially during passing squalls. Large and pounding surf affected the beaches for six or more high tide cycles, during a period of high astronomical tides. By the end of the event, many of the beaches had sustained moderate to major beach erosion. The erosion damaged several home foundations/patios/pools, and endangered many other beach-front residences and two businesses. Numerous beach cross-overs and lifeguard towers were damaged and sand was washed onto coastal roadways and beach parking areas in several locations. Damage estimates for the east-central Florida beaches totalled 46 million dollars.",360,,,,

The hurricane brought tropical storm force gusts to Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties, resulting in scattered trees and power lines down that led to numerous power outages. High seas and storm surge also brought moderate beach erosion and pier damage in Broward and Palm Beach Counties and minor beach erosion in Miami-Dade county. The following inundation values (height above mean higher high water) were measured along the coast: Lake Worth Pier: 1.49 feet and Virginia Key: 1.083 feet. Rainfall generally ranged from 2 to 3 inches with no impacts from inland flooding. ||The collective effects of Hurricane Matthew in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties on October 6-7 resulted in about $32 million in beach-related damage and about $2 million in wind damage. ||County by county impacts are as follows:||In Palm Beach County, trees were downed across the county, most numerous in the northern part of the county from Palm Beach Gardens to Jupiter and Tequesta. Winds also ripped multiple awnings off storefronts within the Downtown area of West Palm Beach. Tree and power line damage resulted in up to 71,000 customers without power at the peak of the event. Moderate beach erosion was reported along county beaches with the most significant erosion from Singer Island to Tequesta. Estimated damage to beaches is around $21 million. Evacuations were recommended for residents of the county barrier islands and mobile-home parks, and many areas east of the US 1 corridor within the county. A few cities also issued mandatory evacuations for their jurisdictions. A total of 6387 people took shelter in county shelters during the event. Wind damage totals are estimated around $1.3 million dollars. ||In Broward County, the rough seas and beach erosion led to damage to the Deerfield Beach Pier. Trees and power lines were downed across the county, resulting in 11,000 customers without power at the peak of the storm. Voluntary evacuations were ordered for residents in low-lying areas and mobile homes.||In Miami-Dade County, a few trees and power lines were downed, resulting in over 16,000 customers without power at the peak of the event. Damages were estimated at $1.2 million dollar across the county. Voluntary evacuations were ordered for residents in low-lying areas and mobile homes, and a total of 700 people took shelter in county shelters during the event.",464,,,,

Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County.

Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.",499,,,,

Storm total rainfall included 11.04 inches 10 mile SW of Jacksonville, 11 inches 12 miles SSE of Jacksonville, 9.2 inches at the Jacksonville International Airport, 7.96 inches at Mayport Naval Air Station and 7.08 inches at Jacksonville Naval Air Station.","Hurricane Irma's eye passed west of the local forecast area, with the region on the storm's turbulent east side. Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.",500,,,,

The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators. Initial and incomplete damage estimate across the area is estimated to be around $800 million, but in all likelihood will be much higher once damage assessments are completed. $222.5 million in damage came in from Collier County, and about $300 million from Palm Beach County.

River flooding caused to enter some homes adjacent to the Halifax River, primarily in Ormond Beach, Holly Hill and north Daytona Beach. Many docks and boat houses along the Indian, Banana and Halifax Rivers were damaged from the combination of high water and wave action. ||Rainfall totals of 10-15 inches were widespread across east-central Florida. The highest totals occurred in a swath from northern St. Lucie County to far southern Indian River County, where accumulations reached 15 to nearly 22 inches. A significant portion of this rain fell during the early morning hours of September 10 as excessive rain bands trained onshore ahead of the main rain area associated with Hurricane Irma. Flooding entered several homes and many roadways became impassible. Hurricane rain bands also resulted in flooding of homes and roadways in many other areas later on September 10, including Fellsmere (Indian River County) where a dozen people were rescued from flood waters and north Merritt Island (Brevard County) where water approached or entered several homes. During the early morning hours of September 11, flooding breached several hundred homes and resulted in the rescue of 200 residents in Orlo Vista (Orange County) when a lake and adjacent retention ponds overflowed. ||Widespread heavy rain fell within the St. Johns River basin and caused the entire river (from Cocoa in Brevard County to Astor in Lake County) to reach flood stage.

Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin.

Major flooding occurred at this level. At 8:15 am on 9/11, the public reported power lines were blown down on SW 8th Street in Lake Butler.","Hurricane Irma's eye passed west of the local forecast area, with the region on the storm's turbulent east side. Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.",57,,,,

Storm tide peaked at 3.6 ft on Sept. 11th at 7:15 pm (datum MHHW).","Hurricane Irma's eye passed west of the local forecast area, with the region on the storm's turbulent east side. Widespread tropical storm force winds with gusts to hurricane force were felt across much of the area, with the strongest winds surging up the Florida east coast during the pre-dawn hours of Sept. 11th. Extensive tree and power line damage occurred across the local area from the winds. One of the greatest local impacts exacerbated by Irma's rainfall and storm surge was river flooding. Prior to Irma's arrival, a local nor'eastern developed 3 days prior, with strong onshore flow pumping water into the St. Johns River basin. Elevated water levels of 1-2 ft above normal tidal departure were already ongoing for several tidal cycles before Irma's surge and rainfall. The nor'easter also brought localized heavy rainfall bands, with some areas near the coast realizing 4-6 inches in 24 hrs the days prior to Irma. In addition, precursor conditions to the nor'easter included an above average rainfall across the region during the summer months.  Major, historic river flooding was forecast along Black Creek and the Sante Fe a week prior to Irma. Realized river values along the St. Johns surpassed prior record levels set by Hurricane Dora in 1964, during low tide the morning of Sept. 11th. The St. Johns River basin continued to rise with the combination of trapped tides due to the nor'easter, astronomically high tides heading into the spring tide season, storm surge of up to 5 ft in some areas, fresh water rainfall of 7-11 inches, and strong southerly winds pushing the water across the basin on the east side of Irma. Historic river flooding occurred across much of NE Florida Sept 11th through the following week as water levels were slow to funnel out of the St. Johns basin. Coastal infrastructure that was already weakened about 1 year ago due to Hurricane Matthew suffered the most damage from Irma's storm surge.",60,,,,

Gordon then tracked northwest into portions of inland southeast Mississippi late on the night of September 4th into the early morning of September 5th. ||Gordon produced sustained tropical storm force winds Greene and George counties in Mississippi, coastal Alabama, as well as Escambia County in Florida. The strongest winds were confined to the immediate coast, with Dauphin Island experiencing gusts to hurricane force in the northern eyewall. Wind gusts to hurricane force were reported on Dauphin Island with sustained tropical storm force winds reported as far north as the |Mobile Regional Airport. Some homes on Dauphin Island experienced roof and siding damage. Isolated to scattered down trees and power outages were reported in southern mobile county. Further east, tropical storm force winds, primarily in gusts, impacted areas of Baldwin county south of interstate 10 with the strongest winds along the immediate coast. Strong tropical storm force winds were felt on the Ft. Morgan peninsula where a few homes suffered some siding or roof damage. The steeple was blown off of the Romar Beach Baptist church in Orange Beach. Some trees were downed and scattered power outages were reported. In Escambia County, FL, tropical storm force wind gusts impacted the southern half of the county, especially in the Pensacola metro and the immediate coast. Sustained tropical storm force winds were reported at Pensacola NAS. One fatality was reported near Pensacola when a tree fell onto a mobile home and killed a small child. In Greene and George counties in Mississippi, tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines, particularly in the Merrill and Richton communities.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",96,,,,

Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area.
